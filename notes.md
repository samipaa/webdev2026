## note that most of the stuff taught in the videos were familiar to me from the previous course and hobby work


### 1. This episode was just an introduction to the series. Everyone introduces themselves.

### 2. Burke explains what is JavaScript.

Webapps are so slow and inefficient and I think it's lazy practice, even if it makes cross-platform development easier.
